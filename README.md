### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Brooklyn, NYC, currently building transformative labor marketplace solutions at **[Traba](https://traba.work)** — a rapidly scaling startup backed by Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, and General Catalyst. I graduated **Summa Cum Laude** with a 4.0 GPA in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, and I'm passionate about creating elegant, scalable systems that solve real-world problems.

Previously, I engineered high-performance backends and data systems at Simon Computing and Performant Software, optimizing databases handling millions of records and building solutions used by thousands of users. I also placed **top 10 in the US** (top 0.1%) in IMC's Prosperity Trading Challenge, competing against 7,000+ teams with algorithmic trading strategies.

Beyond the code, I'm the co-founder of **Lighthouse Startups**, a non-profit dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship in the student community. I believe in using technology as a force for positive change and building products that matter.
